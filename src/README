There is a full unit test suite provided in unit-tests.

Our example program is UnitedStatesCities

As required by the assignment description we split our code into two parts: the rep layer and 
the engine layer. 

The rep layer expands only slightly on the heirarchy that was present in 
the starter code: we force every Rep to descend from InstanceImpl in order to give us the 
ability to add a little bit of housekeeping information in. For each class of entity
there is a corresponding Rep class. LocationRep, SegmentRep, etc. Each of these maintains
a reference to the InstanceManager that created it. The reps all access the engine through
the reference thta the InstanceManager holds.

The Engine layer is more complicated. We have two "classes" of class in our engine layer.
There are "Entitys" which are as described in the class. Entity objects inherit from 
PtrInterface and are required to have a name. There are also "Ordinal" types which 
inherit from the given Ordinal class. These types are unnamed and are never used with
pointers. Each ordinal type implements a "string" operator that is appropriate to its type
and also has a constructor which limits them to valid values.

There are several kinds of entities. In our system we have:

* fleet
* location
** terminal
*** boat terminal
*** plane terminal
*** truck terminal
** customer
** port
* segment
* statistics
* connectivity

Each of these types of entities has its own class. 

Over all of these entities there is an Engine object. The engine is responsible for holding
references (indexed by name) to each of the entities in the simulation. It also holds all 
of the factory methods for creating entities and provides a Notifiee interface that allows
Statistics objects to listen to it.


Design decisions:
==========

We decided to store non-existent return segments and sources as "NULL" values in the corresponding
attributes. This leads to a few issues with null checking, and also makes it slightly
difficult to distinguish between an invalid name and an uninitialized property at the engine layer.
We deal with this by checking at the rep layer that all names that are used to assign "source"
and "return segment" are valid.

We also implemented the bookkeeping associated with returnSegments and deleting sources without
notifications. We felt that it was simpler for our use case.

Error handling:

We decided to handle errors by throwing exceptions at the engine layer. These exceptions bubble 
to the rep layer where they are caught by catch statements in #attribute and #attributeIs in 
the appropriate rep classes. At this point an error message is logged. The exception types
are generic but include specific messages as members. We did not choose to display 
the more detailed error messages although this is certainly a possibility.


Semantics:
========

We have implemented our collections according to Cheritan's semantics. In general they return "NULL"
for missing elements, and they never throw exceptions.

Our mutators are all exception-free (except for when invalid values are set.)
Our getters are all nilpotent.

Our notifications all implement synchronous processing as opposed to asynchronous processing.
There are a few instances where this assumption matters (mostly for statistics) but this would
be fixable.
